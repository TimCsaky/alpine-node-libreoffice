## What is Alpine Node LibreOffice?

This Docker image contains the open source LibreOffice application running on Alpine Node.
Alpine Node is a minimal Node.js built on Alpine Linux.

This image is part of a [group of common components](https://github.com/bcgov/common-services-team-library), developed by the [Common Services Showcase Team](https://bcgov.github.io/common-service-showcase/).

## What Does it Do?

This Image provides a minimal Linux environment and LibreOffice, used by our Common Document Generation Service ([bcgovimages/common-document-generation-service](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bcgovimages/common-document-generation-service)) to run the popular Express framework and Carbone JS library.
